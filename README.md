# What I Did Today
Slight twist on the "To Do" list. This app is designed to help you track and celebrate all the small wins and accomplishments achieved each day.

## Momentum
New name to illustrate the purpose of the app. Get into action with small victories that build momentum and get you into the flow.

## How it is built
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The initial setup follows the project found on Mozilla MDN web docs (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/React_getting_started).
