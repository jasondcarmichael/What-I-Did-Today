# What I Did Today
Basic "To Do" list based on the project found on Mozilla (see reference below). 

User can add a task, mark the task as complete, edit the task name, delete the task, and sort tasks by completed, active, and all.

## How it is built
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The initial setup follows the project found on [Mozilla MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/React_getting_started).

Credit for the DateTime component goes to this [Medium article](https://medium.com/create-a-clocking-in-system-on-react/create-a-react-app-displaying-the-current-date-and-time-using-hooks-21d946971556).
